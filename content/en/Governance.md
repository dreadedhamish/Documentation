## Governance on the THIRM protocol


As part of our commitment to DeFi (decentralised finance) it was important to THIRM to create an ecosystem where governance was not administered by a single party or group but instead was in the hands of token holders.

Moving forwards all major decisions will be made by token holders. We encourage all believers in DeFi to help guide the future direction and decisions of THIRM.

The landscape of DeFi is quickly evolving, and we aren't entirely sure what decisions lie ahead of us. We are however an agile team that welcomes innovation, and we are committed to letting the community decide the path we forge.

Some examples of short-term decisions that will be made by token holders are:

1. what tokens to add.
2. what protocols and blockchains to incorporate and bridge to.
3. financial decisions, such as the provision of grants to other projects.
