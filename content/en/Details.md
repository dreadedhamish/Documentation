Whole cryptospace is just set of keys genrating other strings ( addresses, signatures). the good thing is its a one way generation so 1 person can let you know his address ( public key ) without exposing his private keys. this is basic prinicple of crypto - cryptography, which gives cryptocurrecies der names.

while a simple technology the more complex generations allows you to genertaed almost endless crypto address, thru a determinitic generation.

Fact : even the whole Internet domain registery is managed by 7-10 keys, and it the foundation for all communitcation and management of World Wide Web



While ethereum has EVM, that basically allows to to write a program and make it avaible on blockchain to work and function, thus a complete decenterlised approch where the private key is managed and binded within smart contract itself.

but other blockchains such as BTC, LTC, NANO lack these features,

so how we implemnt something decetnerlised way to control these, so called wallets without exposing private keys ? well just like all crypto infrature it depends on private keys, but instead of trusting those keys with all paritipates the keys are generated by a non human actor, THIRM PROTOCOL, the keys are genrated from a crypto seed  ( managed by all directors of thirm foundation, managing root level access thru this seed requires multi sig)

and for all other actors, THIRM protocol works as extension, we extend these crypto currencies so all the data from BTC, LTC, NANo is published on smart contract and verified on chain, giving a transperent overwiew of whole asset exxchnage on ethereum blockchain 



## In short 

THIRM PROTOCOL basically publishes data from BTC, LTC, NANO onto ethereum contracts, and then the decenterlised part takes over and handles everything autonousmly. 
The data published is produced by Thirm Solver and its verified aby all solvers in the THirm Protocol, Ensuring decetnerlisation.
